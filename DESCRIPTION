Description: Extends the approach proposed by Firth (1993) for bias reduction of
    MLEs in exponential family models to the multinomial logistic regression model
    with general covariate types. Modification of the logistic regression score
    function to remove first-order bias is equivalent to penalizing the likelihood
    by the Jeffreys prior, and yields penalized maximum likelihood estimates (PLEs)
    that always exist. Hypothesis testing is conducted via likelihood ratio, score
    or Wald statistics. Profile confidence intervals (CI) are constructed for the
    PLEs.
